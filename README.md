# Probabilistic Game Strategy Optimization with Monte Carlo Simulations

**Tags:** Game Theory, Monte Carlo, Dynamic Programming, Strategy Simulation, Turn-Based Games

---

## Overview

This project explores **optimal strategy development** for turn-based games using probabilistic modeling and **Monte Carlo simulations**. The game environment features opponents with varying play styles (random, greedy, adaptive), and the system is built to:

- Predict winning probabilities using **dynamic programming (DP)** and **probabilistic analysis**
- Simulate thousands of games using **Monte Carlo methods**
- Evaluate the long-term performance of strategic vs. non-strategic behaviors

---

## Features

- **Turn-Based Game Engine**: Modular system that supports plug-and-play strategy logic.
- **Strategy Optimizer**:
  - Greedy
  - DP-based optimal
  - Randomized
  - Adaptive/reactive strategies
- **Monte Carlo Simulator**: Executes N simulations per strategy pair to estimate win rates and expected performance.
- **Performance Analysis**: Reports average outcomes, variances, and strategy rankings.
- **Opponent Modeler**: Simulates intelligent, semi-intelligent, or random opponents for robust testing.
